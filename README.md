Project Description
-----------------------
According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse the drug usage related cost can reach or even exceed the annual $740 billion dollar in the USA: accidents from driving under the influence, crimes caused by or driven by drugs, healthcare cost, or when people dropout from potential workforce. The deaths caused by drug overdose is steadily increasing every year.

Our purpose of the study is to identify the groups of people who are more likely to become users of a certain drug, so that we can reach them with preventive programs or targeted education that can keep them from becoming drug users.
